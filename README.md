# pedcheck
Mendelian pedigree check for parent-offspring realtionships based on genotype data.

The check is based on counting the number of opposite alleles between two individuals (e.g. AA vs GG).

The number of these errors should be below the assumed genotyping error, otherwise it's an indication of a more distant relationship.
